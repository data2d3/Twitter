# streaming tweets with tweepy

tweepy is a a well written and super easy to use to stream tweets. _computermacgyver's_ has written some excellent code to stream tweets. We will walk through his code in this video.  

# Code

The code for the tutorial can be found at [https://github.com/data2d3/Twitter/edit/main/tweepy_twitter-python-streamer](https://github.com/data2d3/Twitter/edit/main/tweepy_twitter-python-streamer)

I made a couple of small changes to _computermacgyver's_ excellent code [https://github.com/computermacgyver/twitter-python](https://github.com/computermacgyver/twitter-python) but the code is basically the same. The purpose is to create a video that walks through  _computermacgyver's_ excellent code.



# Steps

Install tweepy

```bash
$pip install tweepy
```

1. Update Auth.py with your credentials and have it in the same directory as streaming.py
  a.  Update the following lines with the information displayed in the web browser for your application: 

```python
    consumer_key="..." #Note this is now called API key	
    consumer_secret="..." #Note this is now called API secret
    access_token="..." 
    access_token_secret="...."
    #Replace the â€¦ with whatever values are shown in your web browser. Be sure to keep the quotation marks.
```

   b. Save the file as auth.py (not the same name as before)


2. Create a directory called Tweets
3. Within the Tweets directory, create a file called FILTER (all uppercase) with a list of keywords (as many as you want) one per line in the Tweets folder

  a.  note that you can use _touch_ on a Mac or linux to create a blank file called FILTER that you can edit in any text editor
```bash
$touch FILTER
```

5. Run the script python streaming.py

```bash
$ python streaming.py
```

or

```
$ python streaming.py >> logfile 2>> errorfile
```    

7. It will run indefinitely until you kill it or shut your computer down
8. The tweets will be saved as a .json file in the Tweets folder. We will discuss how to convert the data to .csv and explore it in other videos.
